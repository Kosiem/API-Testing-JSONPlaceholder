# API-Testing-JSONPlaceholder
Test cases written in practice using the free JSONPlaceholder API and <br>
![POSTMAN](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=postman) 


As part of my learning, I created basic test scenarios based on the JSONPlaceholder API. These include handling PUT, POST, GET, DELETE and PATCH queries across multiple resources, also using JavaScript-written tests to automatically validate query results, or to write needed variables to the environment.

Everything was done in Postman.

Below is a link to the documentation of the tests.

Disclaimer:

Some of the queries may not always work, this is due to a limitation of the API that I don't save the changes made permanently, but in my tests I still continued to work on it as if the modified entries still existed, checking that they were changed correctly, deleting them and checking that they were deleted. This project, is meant to be a simulation of working on a real API :D.

The collection has been exported, you can import it into Postman and check how it works in the program, or play around with it as you like.
